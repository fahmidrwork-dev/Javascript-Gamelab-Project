# 🎮 JavaScript Game Development Tasks — Educa Studio (Gamelab Indonesia)

This repository contains **11 JavaScript exercises and mini-projects** I completed during my **Game Development Internship (PKL/Magang)** at **Educa Studio — Gamelab Indonesia**.

All projects were built using **pure JavaScript** and **HTML Canvas**, focusing on programming logic and basic game mechanics *without a game engine*.

# 🧪 JavaScript Projects (1–11)

## **1. console.log Introduction**

Learned to print text and values using:

* `console.log()`
* basic string + number output

---

## **2. Manual Calculator in console.log**

Created simple calculations directly in the console:

* addition
* subtraction
* multiplication
* division

Practiced arithmetic and expression evaluation.

---

## **3. Variable + If/Else Logic Test**

Used `var` to store data and:

* checked conditions
* printed different outputs

Example:

```js
if (banjir == 0) {
  console.log("tidak banjir");
} else {
  console.log("rawan banjir");
}
```

---

## **4. Number Pyramid Generator**

Generated a descending number pyramid from **1 to 4**, using loops.

Skills:

* nested loops
* pattern printing

---

## **5. Fibonacci Sequence Generator**

Created a Fibonacci generator that outputs:
`1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, …`

Skills:

* indexing
* mathematical sequences
* loop-based calculations

---

## **6. Basic Canvas Setup (ctx + element)**

Learned how to:

* create a `<canvas>` element
* get its `2D` context
* draw shapes and images

This was the foundation for rendering.

---

## **7. Canvas Text & Image Styling**

Practiced:

* text alignment (`left`, `center`, `right`)
* different font sizes
* image filtering
* customized visual rendering

---

## **8. Conditional Star Rendering**

Created logic so a star **only appears when the background is blue**.

Skills:

* conditional drawing
* fill styles
* canvas layering

---

## **9. Mouse Interaction + Ball Physics**

Built interactive behavior:

* when mouse enters a box → a ball appears
* when left-clicked → the ball moves randomly
* the ball always falls downward (gravity-like effect)

Skills:

* mouse events
* random movement
* simple gravity simulation

---

## **10. Clipping / Occlusion Color Change**

Made a mechanic where:

* if an object goes **behind** a blue box → its color changes to **pink**

Skills:

* occlusion logic
* draw order management
* object state changes

---

## **11. Final Project — 2D Shooter (Triangle vs Pentagon)**

Built a simple complete shooting game using pure JS + Canvas.

**Features:**

* triangle = player
* pentagon = moving target
* arrow keys = move up/down
* spacebar = shoot
* collision detection
* scoring system
* continuous animation loop

Skills:

* `requestAnimationFrame()` game loop
* keyboard input handling
* projectile logic
* hit detection
* score tracking

---

# 🎯 Summary

Across these 11 projects, I learned:

* core JavaScript programming
* loops, conditions, and logic
* Canvas drawing and rendering
* event handling (mouse + keyboard)
* simple physics and animation
* building a full mini-game from scratch

These exercises form my foundation for more advanced game development using JavaScript.
